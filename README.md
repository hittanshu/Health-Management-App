# OOP-HealthManagementApp
The health management app made using Java is a comprehensive solution that helps patients, doctors, and administrators to manage healthcare services effectively. The app has three primary modules - patient, doctor, and admin, along with a chatbot made using OpenAI API.

The patient module allows patients to view their medical history, schedule appointments with doctors, and receive reminders for medication and tests. The module has a user-friendly interface that enables patients to access their health information quickly and efficiently.

The doctor module allows doctors to view the medical records of their patients & schedule appointments. The module provides doctors with a platform to communicate with their patients in real-time and access medical information whenever required.

The admin module allows administrators to manage patient records, appointments, and schedules. Administrators can also view doctor schedules.  The module provides administrators with a centralized platform to manage healthcare services and ensure seamless operations.

The chatbot - 'DigiAssist' made using OpenAI API is an intelligent virtual assistant that helps patients with their queries related to healthcare services. The chatbot uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand patient queries and provide appropriate responses.
